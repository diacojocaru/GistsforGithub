# GistsLists
The application allows users to search for Github users and get their public Gists, using the API Gists integration provided by Github.

# Technical Features
- Github API 
- Axios
- Datejs
- React & Thinking in React

I chose React because it is fast and it has a modular structure(boosts and saves time in the development process), it has reusable components (you donâ€™t have to write various codes for the same features), you can use HTML syntax directly in the JS code, also it offers felxibility and you can use it for any project you want (websites, applications etc.).

I used Jest for testing the application. It is the best way to test JS code in parallel, it is fast and it allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly.


# Future Improvements
- Improve front-end
- Show more details of the Git users.
- Gists filter (by date, programming language)
- Improve performance for larger Git profiles with more Gists.

# Test the project
- You need to have Node installed
- Run npm install
- Run npm test
- (*ONLY If error occurs, follow the instructions on your terminal*)
